        COST: MEMORIES
        ==============
        MinSegmentDist: 
            The minimum distance each recorded point is from the last.
            The smaller the value, the more accurate/smoother the path
            at the cost of memory.
            
        MaxPathSegments:
            This controls the length of recorded paths.  The larger the
            the longer the path at the expense of memories.
                   
        COST: PERFORMANCE
        =================
        PathFx:
            This controls which animation to use when playing back recorded
            paths.  
            
            NOTE: The Duration of this animation will have performance
            implications.  Longer durations = worse performance.

        COST: FREE-ish?!
        ================
        PathSpeed:
            This controls how fast it plays back recorded paths.  The larger
            the faster.  There is NO performance or memory trade-off.

        PathFadeTime:
            This controls how long each path point lasts (AFTER the animation has stopped)
            in seconds before it fades.
            
            TotalTime = PathFx.Duration + PathFadeTime
            
            While PathFx.Duration carries a performance penalty, PathFadeTime is "mostly" free.
			
		SpawnRadius:
			This controls how close the start point of a path should be in order to draw.
		
		MaxDistance:
			This controls how far away the end of path can be in order to keep drawing.  Paths
			that move out of this range will fade away over PathFadeTime.
